Magento Module I wrote to associate product images from Configurable products to children products. 

I created an index front controller that can be accessed with the path /variationimage.
This runs a function that goes through all of the configurable product children items, checks for an image.
If no image is found the image from the parent product will be associated with the child item.

This is useful because normally you would have to upload a copy of the file multiple times for each child product. 
This script automates that process and eliminates redundancy and extra files.
