Hi,
This repo was created to show my coding skills.

Here are some samples of wordpress functions and code that I wrote for a recent project. You can see the site live at http://www.goalproductions.com

I have also included php logic I wrote for magento to manage multiple affilate networks and only award commission to the active affiliate cookie.
